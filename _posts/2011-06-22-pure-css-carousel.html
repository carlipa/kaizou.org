I have been playing for a while with CSS transitions and animations, but I didn't take the time to post anything on the subject.<!--more-->
Here is a small example of a pure CSS carousel using CSS3 animations. 
<object width="800" height="600" data="/code/carousel" style="overflow:hidden"></object>
It works on Chrome, Safari (with a few z-index glitches), and hopefully soon on Firefox 5.0.
