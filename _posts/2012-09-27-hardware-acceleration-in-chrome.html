<p>Even with a very recent hardware and the latest version of chrome, some users are not able to benefit from hardware acceleration by default.<!--more--></p>
<p>The first thing is to verify that your graphic card is correctly recognized, by typing <a href='chrome://gpu'><code>chrome://gpu</code></a> in the url bar, and verifying that everything is green in the diagnostics</p>
<p>If your graphic card has been blacklisted, you can still force hardware acceleration by selecting the 'Ignore the software rendering list' option in <a href='about:flags'><code>about:flags</code></a></p>
