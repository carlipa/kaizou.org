<p>Following a previous post about <a href="/2009/02/http-caching-explained/">HTTP 1.1 caching mechanisms</a>,<!--more--> I have been asked whether common browsers were actually compliant or not, so I wrote a little test to verify if at least basic features were supported.</p><p>The results for your browser will appear in the frame below.</p>
<object type="text/html" data="/code/cache/index.html"></object>
<p>Update: This is a new version with cache headers completely handled by PHP instead of using apache mod_expires. I had to do this because I could'nt deactivate chunk transfer encoding of pages generated by php on my host, and this prevents HTTP 1.1 caching headers to be inserted by apache ... the test seems to work now, but it is still in beta</p>
