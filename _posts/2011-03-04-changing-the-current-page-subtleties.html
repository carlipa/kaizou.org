<p>The window.location object has two methods to tell the browser to navigate to a new URL: <code>replace</code> and <code>assign</code>.<!--more-->
The only difference between the two methods is that <code>window.location.replace</code> will not insert a new page in the history: as a consequence, the user will not be able to return to the original page using the back button of the browser.</p>
<p>In all automatic redirection use cases, using <code>window.location.replace</code> makes sense, as the web developer probably doesn't want the user to be able to come back to the original page, but there are several other use cases where <code>window.location.assign</code> makes more sense, because you actually want the user to be able to use the back button.</p>
<p>So, you would expect both methods to be equally popular, right ? Wrong !</p>
<p>Google search on <code>window.location.replace</code> -> more than 47 millions responses ...</p>
<p>Google search on <code>window.location.assign</code> -> only 280 000 responses !</p>
<p>Okay, maybe that's because <code>window.location.assign("url")</code> is equivalent to <code>window.location.href="url"</code>. Well, not only ...</p>
<p>Google search on <code>window.location.href</code> -> "only" 12 millions responses ...</p>
<p>So, I am now wondering whether people use <code>window.location.replace</code> because it is what they need or just because it comes out first when they google for a way to change a page using javascript ...</p>
