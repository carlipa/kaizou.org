<p>The HTML version you are using everyday is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/" alt="W3C HTML 4.0.1 specification">HTML 4.0.1</a>, defined back in 1999 by the W3C.</p><!--more-->
<p>Its XML counterpart is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/" alt="W3C XHTML 1.1 specification">XHTML 1.1</a>, successor of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" alt="W3C XHTML 1.0 specification">XHTML 1.0</a> defined in 2000 and revised in 2002 by the W3C.</p>
<p>The newest XHTML 2.0 was at first meant to replace both, but the fact that it was not compatible with XHTML 1.1 raised quite a controversy.</p>
<p>This, added to the fact that some major internet companies and non-profit organizations wanted to expand the typical browser experience to include other internet usages like messaging and media playback led to the creation of the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/" title="Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a> (WHATWG), that released in 2005 the first version of the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/" alt="WHATWG HTML 5 specification">HTML 5 specification</a>.</p>  
<p>The W3C started in 2007 a new HTML working group that took the WHATWG HTML 5 specification as a basis, leading to the publication of the first <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" alt="HTML 5 W3C working draft">HTML 5 draft</a> in 2008.</p> 
<p>The W3C HTML 5 working group is led by <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/" alt="Hixie">Ian Hickson</a> from Google, Inc (WHATWG HTML 5 specification editor, CSS 2.1 co-editor, <a href="http://acid2.acidtests.org/#top" alt="Acid 2 CSS test">Acid2</a> and <a href="http://acid3.acidtests.org/#top" alt="Acid 3 CSS test">Acid3</a> developer) and <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/" alt="Surfin' Safari">David Hyatt</a> from Apple, Inc (Safari/Webkit project leader, Firefox co-founder).</p>
<p>The HTML 5 specification defines both HTML and XHTML document types.</p> 
<p>The W3C maintains a list of <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/html4-differences/" alt="HTML 5 differences from HTML 4">differences between HTML 5 and HTML 4</a>.</p>
<p>I will try to explain these differences in separate posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2009/03/new-html-5-block-level-elements/" alt="New HTML 5 block elements"><code><pre>&lt;section&gt;</pre></code> and associated new block-level elements</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/2009/04/html-5-audio-video-elements/" alt="HTML 5 audio and video elements"><code><pre>&lt;audio&gt;</pre></code> & <code><pre>&lt;video&gt;</pre></code> elements</a>,</li>
<li><a href="/2009/04/html-5-offline-web-applications/" alt="HTML 5 offline web applications">offline web applications</a>,</li>
