        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is David Corvoysier and I am a French Computer Scientist.</p>
        <p>My two pillars are Web and Open Source. I strongly believe that the Web Platform is the best place to bind together technology, information and services and deliver them to the people. I also strongly believe that keeping the Web open is not only good from an ethical point of view, but is also necessary for its own survival, because in the end, closed systems are doomed to die. I am equally pragmatic when it comes to Open Source: I believe in Open Source not only because the concept is morally appealing, but because it produces better results than closed source.</p>
