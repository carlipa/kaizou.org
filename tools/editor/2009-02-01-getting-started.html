You don't need to install anything to start using the Kaizou editor.

However, we must inform you that it works faster with the Kaizou Firefox extension.
<ul>

</ul>
<h2><a href="/editor/editor.php">Try Kaizou web online editor (beta)</a></h2>
Thanks to the Kaizou online editor, you will be able to modify any web page and see the result instantly.

Two modification types are available:
<ul>

</ul>

<h2><a href="/category/editor/">Browse Kaizou files on this site</a></h2>

Each file is presented with its description and two links:
