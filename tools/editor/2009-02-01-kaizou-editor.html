<h2>Welcome to the Kaizou Web Editor</h2>
Ever wanted to have a really customized web experience ? Kaizou is just for you !

With Kaizou, you can edit any online web page, save your changes to your local disk and share them with your friends.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="/editor/kaizou-o-matic.php?id=10">
Google has been totally kaizoed !</a></h2>
Still not convinced ? You can use Kaizou to :
<ul>
	<li><a href="/editor/kaizou-o-matic.php?id=7">provide an unofficial revamping of a specific web page</a>,</li>
	<li><a href="/editor/kaizou-o-matic.php?id=5">share your thoughts on a particular web page by commenting it</a>,</li>
	<li><a href="/editor/kaizou-o-matic.php?id=8">apply a text converter to any page (like 'see the web as yoda does')</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does-it work ?</h2>
Kaizou-links or "klinks" are special links that can be embedded in Web pages. Clicking on a  <a href="http://blog.kaizou.org/kaizou-specifications/kaizou-links-klinks/">Klink</a> will open the corresponding target page and apply the Kaizou modifications to it.

Klinks are actually pointing at files based on a specific <a href="http://blog.kaizou.org/kaizou-specifications/">description format</a>
based on XML.

Note: Kaizou offers editing tools for those who don't speak XML fluently.
